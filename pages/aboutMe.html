                My name is Autumn Kelley. I am an out of state honors student from Georgia, majoring in Emerging Media (Pending) and minoring in Environmental Studies at UCF.
                I hope to go into the Animation and Visualization track and plan to graduate in May 2028.
            </p>
        <p>I first got into animation in 2019 during middle school, when like many others, I decided I wanted to create an art Youtube channel. 
        I watched and still enjoy creators such as Jaiden Animations, who were big inspirations. From learning on flipaclip on my phone, to taking a 2023 Pre-college program at Ringling and using
        industry standard programs, it has been a wonderful, growing art journey that I am excited to continue pursuing.</p>
        <p>I love movement both within my art and physically. I specifically adore 2D animation, especially in older Disney movies such as Aristocats and of course, 
        Studio Ghibli films. I believe the emphasis and beauty in the drawings help bring the stories to life, something I hope to do as an animator/artist as well.
        Everyone has a story, so being able to share and connect with others and convey complex thoughts and emotions is powerful.
        As for physical movement, I really enjoy running, weight lifting, biking, and rock climbing.</p>
